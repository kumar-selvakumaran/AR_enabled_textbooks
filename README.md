# AR enabled textbooks

<h3> publication: <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10193488">[link]</a><h3> 

<h3>Context</h3>

- This is a <a href="https://www.tanscst.tn.gov.in/">TNSCST</a> funded project.

- The request was to build a project that can enhance the education system in under-privileged communities.

- Nowadays, With many smart phone makers releasing phones that are still considerably capable, they are becoming suprisingly common in economically backward communities and parts of society [1,2]. **We leverage this situation.**

- Using open-source technologies, A system is developed with minimal overhead costs to enhance the learning experience of using traditional textbooks using only a smart phone.

- AR visualizations of concepts are integrated into textbooks which can be accessed using a smartphone.


<h3>Implementation details</h3>

- This project aims to develop **Android** apps that host **QR marker** based AR experiences. 

- **Sketchfab** and **Blender** are used to obtain and modify 3d models which will star in the AR visualizations.

- **Vuforia AR SDK** is used to generated, store markers, and to optimize marker-tracking.

- The **Unity AR foundation** Framework is used to create AR visualizations, and the Android applications that hose these AR visualizations.
